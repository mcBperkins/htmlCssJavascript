# Team Profile Page - Project Guide

## Project Overview

You and your team will create another "About Us" page that shows information about each team member - similar to our first website and our first data collection effort. However, this time you'll use JavaScript variables to store information and also use JavaScript to do some simple calculations to display interesting team stats!


**Team Size:** 2 students

---

## What You'll Learn

- Working together on one shared project
- Using variables to store information
- Doing simple calculations (adding, averaging, etc.)
- Displaying the stored information on a webpage
- Making it look presentable with CSS

---

## üë• Team Roles

Everyone contributes! Here's how you might divide the work:

### Content
- Collect everyone's information
- Help organize the HTML structure
- Make sure everyone's section is included

### Coding
- Set up the JavaScript variables
- Write the calculations
- Connect JavaScript to HTML

### Design
- Style the page with CSS
- Choose colors and fonts
- Make it look professional

**IMPORTANT:** Everyone should write at least SOME JavaScript!  Use live share in VS Code to split up the work.  For example, someone can plug in their variable values in a shared JavaScript file.  Someone could work on the CSS on their own too, and share the styling with their teammate who is working more on the HTML and JavaScript.

## Project Requirements

Your project MUST include:

### For Each Team Member (fill the following in and pick at least two more of your own questions/answers):
- [ ] First name
- [ ] Age
- [ ] Favorite video game
- [ ] Favorite song or artist
- [ ] Best thing they've ever eaten
- [ ] Where they'd go out to eat on a Monday night
- [ ] Do they think pit bulls are scary? (Yes/No)
- [ ] Kobe or LeBron?
- [ ] What they'll be doing in 5 years
- [ ] *You must add at least two of your own questions! Maybe how many of you have won knockout üòä*

### Team Calculations (at least these 3):
- [ ] Total combined age of team
- [ ] Average age of team
- [ ] Total number of team members
- [ ] *Add more if you want!*

### Styling:
- [ ] Custom colors and fonts (DO NOT use what is provided - make it look the way you'd style your own personal website - look around online for inspiration)
- [ ] Each team member has their own styled section
- [ ] Page looks organized and fun

## üöÄ Starter Code

### Step 1: Create Your Files

Create three files:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

## üìù Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Setup 

1. **Create your files** and copy the starter code
2. **Open in Live Server** to see it working
3. **Test it** - you should see Alex, Jordan, and Taylor's info
4. **Add your team member names** at the top of script.js

### Phase 2: Add Your Team's Real Info

1. **Each team member fills in their own section:**
   ```javascript
   let member1Name = "Your Real Name";
   let member1Age = 15;  // Your real age
   let member1Game = "Your favorite video game";
   let member1Music = "Your favorite song or artist";
   // ... and so on
   ```

2. **Take turns typing** - one person per member section

3. **Be honest and creative!** These are supposed to be fun answers

4. **Save and refresh** after each person to see the changes

5. **If you have 3 members:**
   - Copy and paste one of the member-card sections in HTML
   - Change all the numbers to 3 (member3-name, member3-age, etc.)
   - Update `totalMembers` to 3
   - Add `+ member3Age` to the totalAge calculation

### Phase 3: Customize the Style

**Make it look like YOUR team!**

**Quick Changes:**

Change the main gradient colors:
```css
body {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b6b 0%, #feca57 100%);
    /* Try different colors! */
}
```

Change the stats box colors:
```css
.team-stats {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b6b 0%, #ee5a6f 100%);
}
```

**Add a team name or motto** - add this to HTML right after the h1:
```html
<p class="team-motto">"Code Hard, Play Harder"</p>
```

Style it in CSS:
```css
.team-motto {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 24px;
    color: #667eea;
    font-style: italic;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
}
```
## Optional to try this - this is getting into logic we have NOT explored yet, so feel free to skip it.  Also, it's not that interesting because there are only two to three members, but if you're curious, see what it does... 

### Phase 4: Add Fun Calculations!

**Make your stats section more interesting!**

**Example 1: Count who picked Kobe vs LeBron**
```javascript
// After your other team calculations, add:
let kobeCount = 0;
let lebronCount = 0;

// Count each person
if (member1Basketball === "Kobe" || member1Basketball === "Kobe forever") {
    kobeCount++;
} else {
    lebronCount++;
}

if (member2Basketball === "Kobe" || member2Basketball === "Kobe forever") {
    kobeCount++;
} else {
    lebronCount++;
}

if (member3Basketball === "Kobe" || member3Basketball === "Kobe forever") {
    kobeCount++;
} else {
    lebronCount++;
}

// Display it
document.getElementById('kobe-count').textContent = kobeCount;
document.getElementById('lebron-count').textContent = lebronCount;
```

Add to HTML in team-stats:
```html
<p>Team Kobe: <span id="kobe-count">0</span> | Team LeBron: <span id="lebron-count">0</span></p>
```

**Example 2: Count who thinks pit bulls are scary**
```javascript
let scaredCount = 0;
let notScaredCount = 0;

// Check each person (look for "yes" or "no" in their answer)
if (member1PitBull.toLowerCase().includes("yes") || member1PitBull.toLowerCase().includes("little")) {
    scaredCount++;
} else {
    notScaredCount++;
}

// ... repeat for member2 and member3

document.getElementById('scared-count').textContent = scaredCount;
document.getElementById('notscared-count').textContent = notScaredCount;
```

**Example 3: How old will everyone be in 5 years?**
```javascript
let member1AgeFuture = member1Age + 5;
let member2AgeFuture = member2Age + 5;
let member3AgeFuture = member3Age + 5;

// Display in each person's card (add to HTML first):
document.getElementById('member1-age-future').textContent = member1AgeFuture;
```

Add to each member's HTML:
```html
<p><strong>Age in 5 Years:</strong> <span id="member1-age-future">0</span></p>
```

**Example 4: Find the most popular restaurant**
```javascript
// This is advanced, but you can try!
console.log("Restaurant votes:");
console.log(member1Name + " votes: " + member1Restaurant);
console.log(member2Name + " votes: " + member2Restaurant);
console.log(member3Name + " votes: " + member3Restaurant);

// You can manually see which one appears most and add it to your page
```

## More Fun Ideas!

### 1. **Add Your Own Questions**

Don't like one of the questions? Change it! Here's how:

**In HTML**, change the question:
```html
<p><strong>üé¨ Favorite Movie:</strong> <span id="member1-movie">?</span></p>
```

**In JavaScript**, add the variable:
```javascript
let member1Movie = "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse";
```

**Display it:**
```javascript
document.getElementById('member1-movie').textContent = member1Movie;
```

**Other question ideas:**
- Favorite TikToker or YouTuber
- Dream car
- Favorite season (winter, spring, summer, fall)
- Cats or dogs?
- Pineapple on pizza? (Yes/No)
- Dream vacation spot
- Favorite subject in school
- If you could have any superpower?

### 2. **Make Cards Interactive**

Add this to your CSS:
```css
.member-card:hover {
    transform: scale(1.02) rotate(1deg);
    box-shadow: 0 12px 35px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### 3. **Add Profile Pictures (Emojis)**

Add at the top of each member card HTML:
```html
<div class="profile-emoji">üéÆ</div>
```

Style it:
```css
.profile-emoji {
    font-size: 80px;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
}
```

Let each person pick their own emoji!

### 4. **Add a "Team Agreements" Section**

Show where your team agrees:

```javascript
// Check if everyone likes LeBron
let allLikeLebron = false;
if (lebronCount === totalMembers) {
    allLikeLebron = true;
}

// Display it
if (allLikeLebron) {
    document.getElementById('team-agreement').textContent = "We all agree: LeBron is the GOAT! üêê";
}
```
