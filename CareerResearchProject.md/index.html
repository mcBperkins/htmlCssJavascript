    <h1>Data Analyst</h1>
    <p>A data analyst's primary responsibility is to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights that guide business decisions. This process is highly cyclical, beginning with data collection from various sources, followed by the time-intensive task of data cleaning and preparation (data wrangling) to ensure accuracy and consistency. Once the data is ready, the analyst performs statistical analysis and interpretation using tools like SQL, Python, or R to identify key patterns, trends, and anomalies that answer specific business questions. The final, critical stage involves data visualization and reporting, where they create compelling charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards (using tools like Tableau or Power BI) to communicate their findings. Ultimately, the analyst serves as the storyteller for the data, collaborating with stakeholders across the organization to translate complex numbers into strategic recommendations for improvement and growth.</p>
